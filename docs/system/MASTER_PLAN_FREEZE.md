7. **Roblox: Agents NEVER launch Studio**
8. **Roblox: All work in /game/src/* only**
9. **Tools separate from agents**
10. **Output to /output only**

**These rules are PERMANENT. No exceptions.**

## Enforcement

**Claude 4.5 Instructions:**

When you resume work on this project:

1. **FIRST:** Read all 4 canonical documents in order
2. **VERIFY:** Check this MASTER_PLAN_FREEZE.md exists
3. **RESPECT:** Do not restructure the master plan
4. **UPDATE:** Only add to existing structure via amendments
5. **DOCUMENT:** Create phase completion reports at phase boundaries

If asked to "rewrite the master plan" or "reorganize the phases":
- ❌ **REFUSE** - The structure is locked
- ✅ **SUGGEST** - Create an amendment instead
- ✅ **EXPLAIN** - Reference this freeze directive

---

## Version Control

**Current Version:** 3.0
**Last Structure Change:** 2025-12-04
**Next Allowed Structure Change:** Never (use amendments instead)

---

## Emergency Override

**ONLY if absolutely necessary:**

If a fundamental flaw is discovered that requires restructuring:
1. Document the flaw in detail
2. Propose the restructure in a separate document
3. Get explicit human approval
4. Create a new version (4.0) with full changelog
5. Archive version 3.0

**This should be extremely rare.**
